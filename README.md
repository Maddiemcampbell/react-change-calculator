# Change Calculator
This app calculates change for a register based on how much is due, how much is received, and how much change is owed. This app splits up how much is owed into how many $20's, $10s, $5s, $1s, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies are owed back to the customer. I really enjoyed working on my UI and styling in this project.
