# Change Calculator
This app calculates change for a register based on how much is due, how much is received, and how much change is owed. This app splits up how much is owed into how many $20's, $10s, $5s, $1s, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies are owed back to the customer. I really enjoyed working on my UI and styling in this project. 

## Challenges
The biggest challenge I faced while making this app was stepping outside of my comfort zone with Angular and really diving deep into learning how to use React efficiently and effectively. This app helped me begin to embrace the power and simplicity React supplies developers with JSX. 

## Wins
My workflow is much faster utilizing React over Angular. I am still a big proponent for using the right tool for a task, which means I am sure I will find myself using Angular over React in the future, but for the time being I am loving the simplicity and ease of use React provides.
